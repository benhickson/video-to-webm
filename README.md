# video-to-webm
Bash Shell script for converting video files to webm with ffmpeg

works on Mac OSX with ffmpeg installed from precompiled and included in Bash's path.

just run the script and it will prompt you for an input file and a targer bitrate.

output files are the same as input, with extension .webm.
